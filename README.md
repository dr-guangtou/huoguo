Interactive visualization of HSC massive galaxies using D3.js

-----

* This is a personal project to learn how to use D3.js to create interactive visualization of astrophysical data. 
* Would like to include:
  - Interactive plot of 2-D relation between physical properties of massive galaxies.
  - Show summary of 3-color picture and 1-D profile of selected galaxy.
