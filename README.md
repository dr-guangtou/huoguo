> My (over-)ambitious goal to achieve `Isophote.x` and `galfit` functions in Python without losing the
> efficiency

## Motivation

* Both 1-D isophotal analysis and 2-D modeling of light distribution of galaxies are useful in dealing with
  images of galaxies.
* The most commonly used 1-D analysis tool is the `ellipse` function in the `stsdas.analysis.isophote`
  package used in `IRAF` environment.
    - The source code is basically written in C.
