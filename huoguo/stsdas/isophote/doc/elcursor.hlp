NAME
elcursor -- Interactive cursor commands for 'ellipse' task.
.ih
DESCRIPTION
If the 'ellipse' task starts with the 'interactive' parameter set to
'yes', a number of cursor commands become available to the user.
Single keystroke, as well as "colon-type" commands are supported.

Using cursor commands, the user can, at any time, list and modify
most control parameters and the current ellipse geometry. 

It is possible to mask/unmask regions in the image, discarding them from 
subsequent fits, at the same time updating the Bad Pixel Mask associated 
with the input image. Regions may be specified by a single keystroke, which 
will mask a square region of specified size centered on the cursor position, 
or by two keystrokes which mark the opposite vertices of a rectangular region.
The two-keystroke mode is switched on by setting the 'region' parameter
to 'yes'.

It is also possible to re-fit at the same semi-major axis length, to go to 
the next semi-major axis, or to specify a completely arbitrary new semi-major
axis, center and orientation.  The cursor returns after each isophote fit, 
until the user selects non-interactive mode, or until all isophotes were
fitted. Also, some level of display control is available with zoom, roam,
reset and grayscale control functions.

The single keystroke commands are:
.ls ?   Print a help summary of available commands.
.le
.ls a 
The cursor position in relation to the current ellipse center is used to 
re-define the current semi-major axis length and the current position angle.
.le
.ls c
Continue: all subsequent fitting will be performed in non-interactive mode,
and ellipse plotting will be disabled.
.le
.ls d
Discard: the current isophote is not written to the output table; the program
proceeds immediately to the next value of the semi-major axis length.
.le
.ls f
Fit: re-fit and plot at the current semi-major axis, do not write to
output table yet.
.le
.ls g
Give up: discard data from current isophote, stop increasing semi-major
axis and go inwards.
.le
.ls h
Continue fitting and plotting in non-interactive mode.
.le
.ls i
Inward: change direction from a growing semi-major axis to a shrinking
semi-major axis.
.le
.ls m
Mask square pixel area under cursor or region.
.le
.ls n
Next: write current isophote, fit and plot at next value of semi-major 
axis length.
.le
.ls o
Zoom out: display fresh image, reset zoom factor to 1.
.le
.ls p
Plot current ellipse.
.le
.ls q
Quit program and close output table.
.le
.ls r
Roam: re-display with centering.
.le
.ls u
Un-mask square pixel area under cursor or region.
.le
.ls x
Take cursor position as new ellipse center.
.le
.ls z
Zoom in.
.le

When the colon (:) key is pressed, control goes temporarily to the text 
window where single line commands can be entered. All commands have a keyword 
and optional value. Typing only the keyword shows the current value of the 
associated parameter. Typing the keyword followed by a space-separated 
value sets the associated parameter to the new value. 

The single exception is the :dispars command, which is used to set (not show) 
a command-line parameter string which is passed to the underlying 'display' 
or 'contour' task which handle image display functions. For example,
the following command can be used to control display grayscale:

.nf
:dispars z1=0 z2=1000 ztrans="log"
.fi

All subsequent display operations (zoom, etc.) will inherit the specified
command-line parameters. Remember that the 'display.zrange' and 
'display.zscale' parameters must be properly set in order for z1 and z2 to 
take effect.

Supported  keywords in colon mode are:

.ls :show [file]

print to a text file.
